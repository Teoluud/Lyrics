            <h1>Inside the Fire</h1>
            <p>
                Oh Devon<br>
                Won't go to Heaven<br>
                She's just another lost soul about to be mine again<br>
                Leave her, we will receive her<br>
                It is beyond your control will you ever meet again?<br>
                <br>
                Devon, one of eleven<br>
                Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child<br>
                She was taken and then forsaken<br>
                You will remember it all, let it blow your mind again<br>
                <br>
                Devon lies beyond this portal<br>
                Take the word of one immortal<br>
                <br>
                Give your soul to me, for eternity<br>
                Release your life to begin another time with her<br>
                End your grief with me, there's another way<br>
                Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her<br>
                <br>
                Sever, now and forever<br>
                You're just another soul about to be mine again<br>
                See her, you'll never free her<br>
                You must surrender it all if you'd like to meet again<br>
                <br>
                Fire, all you desire<br>
                As she begins to turn cold for the final time<br>
                You will shiver, 'til you deliver<br>
                You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again<br>
                <br>
                Devon lies beyond this portal<br>
                Take the word of one immortal<br>
                <br>
                Give your soul to me, for eternity<br>
                Release your life to begin another time with her<br>
                End your grief with me, there's another way<br>
                Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her<br>
                <br>
                Take me away, yeah<br>
                <br>
                Give your soul to me, for eternity<br>
                Release your life to begin another time with her<br>
                End your grief with me, there's another way<br>
                Release your life, take your place inside the fire with her<br>
                <br>
                Oh Devon, one of eleven<br>
                Who had been rendered unwhole as a little child<br>
                She was taken and then forsaken<br>
                You will remember it all, let it fill your mind again man<br>
