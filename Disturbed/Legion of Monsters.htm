        <h1>Legion of Monsters</h1>
        <p>
            The monster shattered the day<br>
            In a place where innocents play<br>
            I was mourning as the headlines shouted his name<br>
            They didn't waste any time<br>
            I was disgusted when the madman's image<br>
            Appeared at the top of the screen<br>
            <br>
            Some were barely alive<br>
            Too many didn't survive<br>
            Still they kept repeating headlines, shouting the name<br>
            Do they not realize<br>
            The future demons with the hope of becoming<br>
            The one at the top of the screen?<br>
            <br>
            They've thrown morality away<br>
            With such depravity, I must say<br>
            <br>
            You made sure the world will remember the name<br>
            But didn't the thought even enter your mind?<br>
            You'd give a new legion of monsters<br>
            A reason to take your life<br>
            <br>
            The pictures drove me insane<br>
            Can't get them out of my brain<br>
            You made certain they were right at the top of the page<br>
            You disrespected the dead<br>
            When the only name was of the one who committed<br>
            The murder at the top of the page<br>
            <br>
            The madman watching with glee<br>
            As the herd of innocents flee<br>
            They saw it all unfold right on the face of the screen<br>
            Perhaps they could be the one<br>
            Who'd become famous for the acts of terror<br>
            Reflected on the face of the screen?<br>
            <br>
            You've thrown morality away<br>
            With such depravity, I must say<br>
            <br>
            You made sure the world will remember the name<br>
            But didn't the thought even enter your mind?<br>
            You'd give a new legion of monsters<br>
            A reason to take your life<br>
            <br>
            And I call you a pimp, as you whore the insane<br>
            The damage you caused you cannot rectify<br>
            You've inspired new legions of monsters<br>
            Determined to take more life<br>
            <br>
            Take a look around, listen to the sound<br>
            Feel it to the ground, fear has come in a wave<br>
            Just another gathering of helpless innocents forced into the grave<br>
            Listen to me now, are you with me now?<br>
            Can you tell me how these vultures still glorify them?<br>
            Let's defy them<br>
            <br>
            Take a look around, listen to the sound<br>

            <br>
            The monster shattered the day<br>
            The monster shattered the day<br>
            You're giving a legion of monsters a reason<br>
