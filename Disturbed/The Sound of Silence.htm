        <h1>The Sound of Silence</h1>
        <p>
            Hello darkness, my old friend<br>
            I've come to talk to you again<br>
            Because a vision softly creeping<br>
            Left its seeds while I was sleeping<br>
            And the vision that was planted in my brain<br>
            Still remains<br>
            Within the sound of silence<br>
            <br>
            In restless dreams, I walked alone<br>
            Narrow streets of cobblestone<br>
            'Neath the halo of a street lamp<br>
            I turned my collar to the cold and damp<br>
            When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light<br>
            That split the night<br>
            And touched the sound of silence<br>
            <br>
            And in the naked light, I saw<br>
            Ten thousand people, maybe more<br>
            People talking without speaking<br>
            People hearing without listening<br>
            People writing songs that voices never shared<br>
            And no one dared<br>
            Disturb the sound of silence<br>
            <br>
            "Fools" said I, "You do not know<br>
            Silence like a cancer grows<br>
            Hear my words that I might teach you<br>
            Take my arms I might reach you"<br>
            But my words, like silent raindrops fell<br>
            And echoed in the wells of silence<br>
            <br>
            And the people bowed and prayed<br>
            To the neon god they made<br>
            And the sign flashed out its warning<br>
            In the words that it was forming<br>
            Then the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls<br>
            In tenement halls"<br>
            And whispered the sound of silence<br>
        </p>
