        <h1>Eye of The Tiger</h1>
        <p>
            Rising up, back on the street<br>
            Did my time, took my chances<br>
            Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
            Just a man and his will to survive<br>
            <br>
            So many times, it happens to fast<br>
            You trade your passion for glory<br>
            Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past<br>
            You must fight just to keep them alive<br>
            <br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
            <br>
            Face to face, out in the heat<br>
            Hanging tough, staying hungry<br>
            They stack the odds 'til we take to the street<br>
            For the kill with the skill to survive<br>
            <br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
            <br>
            Rising up, straight to the top<br>
            Had the guts, got no glory<br>
            Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop<br>
            Just a man and his will to survive<br>
            <br>
            It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
            Rising up to the challenge of our rival<br>
            And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
            And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger<br>
            <br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
            The eye of the tiger<br>
        </p>
