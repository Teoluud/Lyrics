    <h1>Numb Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
        I'm tired of being what you want me to be<br />
        Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface<br />
        Don't know what you're expecting of me<br />
        Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes<br />
        (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br />
        Every step that I take is another mistake to you<br />
        (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)<br />
        <br />
        I've become so numb, I can't feel you there<br />
        Become so tired, so much more aware<br />
        I'm becoming this, all I want to do<br />
        Is be more like me and be less like you<br />
        <br />
