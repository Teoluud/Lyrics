        <h1>Warriors Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            As a child, you would wait and watch away<br>
            But you always knew that you'd be the one<br>
            That work while they all play<br>
            In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme<br>
            Of all the things that you would change<br>
            But it was just a dream<br>
            <br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            From dust<br>
            <br>
            The time will come, when you'll have to rise<br>
            Above the rest and prove yourself<br>
            Your spirit never dies<br>
            Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above<br>
            But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be<br>
            The labor of my love<br>
            <br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            From dust<br>
            <br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            Here we are, don't turn away now<br>
            We are the warriors that built this town<br>
            From dust<br>     
        </p>
