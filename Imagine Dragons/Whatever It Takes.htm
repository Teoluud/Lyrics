        <h1>Whatever It Takes</h1>
        <p>
            Falling too fast to prepare for this<br>
            Tripping in the world could be dangerous<br>
            Everybody circling is vulturous<br>
            Negative, nepotist<br>
            <br>
            Everybody waiting for the fall of man<br>
            Everybody praying for the end of times<br>
            Everybody hoping they could be the one<br>
            I was born to run, I was born for this<br>
            <br>
            Whip, whip<br>
            Run me like a racehorse<br>
            Pull me like a ripcord<br>
            Break me down and build me up<br>
            I wanna be the slip, slip<br>
            Word upon your lip, lip<br>
            Letter that you rip, rip<br>
            Break me down and build me up<br>
            <br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Yeah take me to the top I'm ready for<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do what it takes<br>
            <br>
            Always had a fear of being typical<br>
            Looking at my body feeling miserable<br>
            Always hanging on to the visual<br>
            I wanna be invisible<br>
            <br>
            Looking at my years like a martyrdom<br>
            Everybody needs to be a part of them<br>
            Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son<br>
            I was born to run, I was born for this<br>
            <br>
            Whip, whip<br>
            Run me like a racehorse<br>
            Pull me like a ripcord<br>
            Break me down and build me up<br>
            I wanna be the slip, slip<br>
            Word upon your lip, lip<br>
            Letter that you rip, rip<br>
            Break me down and build me up<br>
            <br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do what it takes<br>
            <br>
            Hypocritical, egotistical<br>
            Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical<br>
            Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box<br>
            An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost<br>
            I'm an apostrophe<br>
            I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see<br>
            I'm just a product of the system of catastrophe<br>
            And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased<br>
            And when I am deceased<br>
            At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily<br>
            And leave the body and my soul to be a part of thee<br>
            I do what it takes<br>
            <br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Yeah take me to the top, I'm ready for<br>
            Whatever it takes<br>
            Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins<br>
            I do what it takes<br>
        </p>
