        <h1>See Me Smiling</h1>
        <p>
            The sun comes up and you are all over my mind<br>
            You're in my brain before I can open my eyes<br>
            As I go on without you, my heartbeat won't slow down<br>
            I need you back like I need air to breathe this out<br>
            <br>
            All I can do is keep you closer now<br>
            'Cause I know you're somewhere out there looking down<br>
            Wherever you are (wherever you are)<br>
            I hope you can see me smiling<br>
            <br>
            The sky gets dark, I watch the water here at home<br>
            It's ten years now and I'm still learning to let go<br>
            It's not the same without you, there's no one keeping time<br>
            You were the rythm that was bringing us to life<br>
            <br>
            All I can do is keep you closer now<br>
            'Cause I know you're somewhere out there looking down<br>
            Wherever you are (wherever you are)<br>
            I hope you can see me smiling now<br>
            (I hope you can see me smiling)<br>
            <br>
            Sometimes I can't help but think that I<br>
            Have you right behind me all this time<br>
            If only you could have a chance to see<br>
            All the happiness you gave to me<br>
            <br>
            All I can do is keep you closer now<br>
            'Cause I know you're somewhere out there looking down<br>
            Wherever you are (wherever you are)<br>
            I hope you can see me smiling now<br>
            (I hope you can see me smiling)<br>
            I hope you can see me smiling<br>
        </p>
