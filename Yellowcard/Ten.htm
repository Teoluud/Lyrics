        <h1>Ten</h1>
        <p>
            Mmmmm<br>
            Mmmmm<br>
            <br>
            I found out in the fall. I've been gone<br>
            On the road for a year<br>
            She said<br>
            "Honey, I've got real bad news" and<br>
            Then there were just tears<br>
            And we would never be the same again<br>
            <br>
            Since then I've often wondered<br>
            What you might have been like<br>
            How it would have felt to hold you<br>
            Would you have had my eyes?<br>
            Don't you think we would've been best friends?<br>
            <br>
            You would be ten and I'd be<br>
            Driving you to school<br>
            You would tell all your friends<br>
            That you thought I was cool<br>
            And you would have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            Yeah, you would have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            <br>
            We were twenty-two years young then<br>
            Breaking rules all around<br>
            We were<br>
            Moving in that first apartment<br>
            It felt like it was never gonna end<br>
            Both so lost and crazy<br>
            We were young so we ran<br>
            Now I live in a dream where I am<br>
            Holding your little hands<br>
            I never got to meet you, my best friend<br>
            <br>
            You would be ten and I'd be<br>
            Driving you to school<br>
            You would tell all your friends<br>
            That you thought I was cool<br>
            You would be out in the sun<br>
            Until it was gone<br>
            You would be watching Star Wars<br>
            With your PJs on<br>
            And you would have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            Yeah, you would have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            <br>
            Mmmmm<br>
            Mmmmm<br>
            <br>
            Don't you think we would've been best friends?<br>
            <br>
            You would be ten and I'd be<br>
            Driving you to school<br>
            You would tell all your friends<br>
            That you thought I was cool<br>
            You would be out in the sun<br>
            Until it was gone<br>
            You would be watching Star Wars<br>
            With your PJs on<br>
            You would be playing tunes on<br>
            On your first guitar<br>
            You would be harmony to<br>
            Every single part of me<br>
            And you have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            Yeah, you would have<br>
            All the love in my heart<br>
            <br>
            Mmmmm<br>
            Mmmmm...<br>
