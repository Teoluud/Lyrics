        <h1>Ordinary Man</h1>
        <p>
            I was unprepared for fame<br>
            Then everybody knew my name<br>
            No more lonely nights<br>
            It's all for you<br>
            <br>
            I have travelled many miles<br>
            I've seen tears and I've seen smiles<br>
            Just remember that<br>
            It's all for you<br>
            <br>
            Don't forget me as the colours fade<br>
            When the lights go down<br>
            It's just an empty stage<br>
            Okay<br>
            <br>
            Yes, I've been a bad guy<br>
            Been higher than the blue sky<br>
            And the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
            I've made grown men cry<br>
            Don't know why I'm still alive<br>
            Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
            <br>
            Many times I've lost control<br>
            They tried to kill my rock 'n' roll<br>
            Just remember I'm still here for you<br>
            I don't wanna say goodbye<br>
            When I do, you'll be all right<br>
            After all, I did it all for you<br>
            <br>
            Don't forget me as the colours fade<br>
            When the lights go down<br>
            It's just an empty stage<br>
            Okay<br>
            <br>
            Yes, I've been a bad guy<br>
            Been higher than the blue sky<br>
            And the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
            I've made grown men cry<br>
            Don't know why I'm still alive<br>
            Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
            <br>
            Yes, I've been a bad guy<br>
            Been higher than the blue sky<br>
            And the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
            I've made grown men cry<br>
            Don't know why I'm still alive<br>
            Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die<br>
            An ordinary man<br>
        </p>
