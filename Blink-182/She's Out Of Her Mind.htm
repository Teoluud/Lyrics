            <h1>She's Out Of Her Mind</h1>
            <p>
                I said settle down, settle down everything is fine<br />
                Take your eyes off the floor<br />
                She said no I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not alright<br />
                I lost my head on the door<br />
                <br />
                She's a-a-a-antisocial<br />
                A-a-and she's an angel, yeah<br />
                <br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind<br />
                She said "babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"<br />
                She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head<br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind, oh yeah<br />
                We all need something to live for, oh yeah<br />
                We all need something to live for<br />
                <br />
                She said I let her down, let her down<br />
                I no longer dream of anything anymore<br />
                Said I'm a know-it-all, know-it-all<br />
                You make me want to scream<br />
                And threw herself on the floor<br />
                <br />
                She's a-a-a-antisocial<br />
                A-a-and she's an angel, yeah<br />
                <br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind<br />
                She said "babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"<br />
                She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head<br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind, oh yeah<br />
                <br />
                She's not complicated<br />
                Can't be overstated at all<br />
                She's not complicated-ated-ated at all<br />
                <br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind<br />
                She said "babe, I'm sorry but I'm crazy tonight"<br />
                She got a black shirt, black skirt and Bauhaus stuck in her head<br />
                I'm in deep with this girl but she's out of her mind, oh yeah<br />
                We all need something to live for, oh yeah<br />
                We all need something to live for<br />
