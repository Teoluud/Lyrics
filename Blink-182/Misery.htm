            <h1>Misery</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a wreck, I'm out of time<br>
                I barely made it out alive<br>
                I'm not bent, I'm not cracked<br>
                I'm just broken<br>
                I watched the fire burn the sea<br>
                I wrapped my car around a tree<br>
                Pulled me up underneath<br>
                This heavy burden<br>
                <br>
                There's a halo in the distance<br>
                Salvation's barely out of reach<br>
                <br>
                Torn apart like the broken-hearted<br>
                Up in smoke with the fire we started<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                Smash it up like there's no tomorrow<br>
                Leave me here with the fear and sorrow<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                <br>
                Tied up to a heart of stone<br>
                I screamed into a microphone<br>
                I burned the bridge, so I won't<br>
                Find my way home<br>
                Lay with me, I can't sleep<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                When I'm bent, when I'm cracked<br>
                When I'm broken<br>
                <br>
                There's a halo in the distance<br>
                Salvation's barely out of reach<br>
                <br>
                Torn apart like the broken-hearted<br>
                Up in smoke with the fire we started<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                Smash it up like there's no tomorrow<br>
                Leave me here with the fear and sorrow<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                <br>
                Fifteen times a night, when the sun's gone down<br>
                In the dark awake and you're not around<br>
                And the closest thought is the edge of oblivion<br>
                Fifteen times a day, when you check you're phone<br>
                And I won't be there and you're all alone<br>
                'Cause we always lived on the edge of oblivion<br>
                Left to find our way through a Hitchcock film<br>
                In an empty bed with an hour to kill<br>
                'Cause it's only fun on the edge of oblivion<br>
                <br>
                Torn apart like the broken-hearted<br>
                Up in smoke with the fire we started<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                Smash it up like there's no tomorrow<br>
                Leave me here with the fear and sorrow<br>
                Misery loves company<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
                I don't need anyone<br>
            </p>
