            <h1>Darkside</h1>
            <p>
                She's a girl dressed in black<br>
                From another world<br>
                Lives and breathes like a girl<br>
                From another world<br>
                She don't know my name<br>
                She don't have the time of day<br>
                <br>
                Celebrate, medicate<br>
                'til we numb the pain<br>
                In this storm it's still dark<br>
                Like it always rains<br>
                She don't feel feel the same<br>
                She don't have the time of day<br>
                <br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait for her<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait for her<br>
                <br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                <br>
                She's a girl I look back<br>
                To what could have been<br>
                Her cloak and dagger mouth<br>
                Tastes like medicine<br>
                She won't last the night<br>
                Spun out in the neon light<br>
                <br>
                You would leave but you need me<br>
                To numb the pain<br>
                You're possessed and you slept<br>
                Through another day<br>
                You don't feel the same<br>
                And I don't have the strength to stay<br>
                <br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait for her<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait, and I wait<br>
                And I wait for her<br>
                <br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                <br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                <br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside<br>
                <br>
                I don't care what you say, no<br>
                I don't care what you do<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
                I'm going to the darkside with you<br>
