        <h1>Bismarck</h1>
        <p>
            From the mist, a shape, a ship, is taking form<br>
            And the silence of the sea is about to drift into a storm<br>
            Sign of power, show of force<br>
            Raise the anchor, battleship's plotting its course<br>
            <br>
            Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel<br>
            Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean<br>
            He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas<br>
            To lead the war machine<br>
            To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine<br>
            The terror of the seas<br>
            The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine<br>
            <br>
            Two thousands men, and fifty thousands tons of steel<br>
            Set the course for the Atlantic with the Allies on their heel<br>
            Firepower, firefight<br>
            Battle Stations, keep the target steady in sight<br>
            <br>
            Into formation, the hunt has begun<br>
            Death and damnation, the fleet is coming<br>
            He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas<br>
            To lead the war machine<br>
            To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine<br>
            The terror of the seas<br>
            The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine<br>
            <br>
            At the bottom of the ocean, the depths of the abyss<br>
            They are bound by iron and blood<br>
            The flagship of the navy, the terror of the seas<br>
            His guns have gone silent at last<br>
            <br>
            Pride of a nation, a beast made of steel<br>
            Bismarck in motion, king of the ocean<br>
            He was made to rule the waves across the seven seas<br>
            To lead the war machine<br>
            To rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine<br>
            The terror of the seas<br>
            The Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine<br>
            <br>
            To lead the war machine<br>
            Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine<br>
            The terror of the seas<br>
            Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine<br>
            To lead the war machine<br>
            Rule the waves and lead the Kriegsmarine<br>
            The terror of the seas<br>
            Bismarck and the Kriegsmarine<br>
