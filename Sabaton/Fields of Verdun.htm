        <h1>Fields of Verdun</h1>
        <p>
            As the drum roll started on that day<br>
            Heard a hundred miles away<br>
            A million shells were fired<br>
            And the green fields turned to grey<br>
            The bombardment lasted all day long<br>
            Yet the forts were standing strong<br>
            Heavily defended<br>
            Now the trap's been sprung and the battle's begun<br>
            <br>
            Descend into darkness<br>
            303 days below the sun<br>
            <br>
            Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, under the gun<br>
            Thy will be done, and the judgement has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, fields of Verdun<br>
            <br>
            Though a million shells had scarred the land<br>
            No one has the upper hand<br>
            From the ground above to trenches<br>
            Where the soldiers make their stand<br>
            As the trenches slowly turned to mud<br>
            And then quickly start to flood<br>
            Death awaits in every corner<br>
            As they die in the mud, fill the trenches with blood<br>
            <br>
            Descend into darkness<br>
            303 days below the sun<br>
            <br>
            Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, under the gun<br>
            Thy will be done, and the judgement has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, fields of Verdun<br>
            <br>
            Fields of execution, turned to wasteland from the grass<br>
            Thou shalt go no further, it was said: "They shall not pass!"<br>
            The spirit of resitance and the madness of the war<br>
            So go ahead, face the lead, join the dead<br>
            Though you die, where you lie, never asking why<br>
            <br>
            Descend into darkness<br>
            303 days below the sun<br>
            <br>
            Fields of Verdun, and the battle has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, under the gun<br>
            Thy will be done, and the judgement has begun<br>
            Nowhere to run, father and son<br>
            Fall one by one, fields of Verdun<br>
