        <h1>To Hell and Back</h1>
        <p>
            A short man from Texas, a man of the wild<br>
            Thrown into combat, where bodies lie piled<br>
            Hides his emotions, his blood's running cold<br>
            Just like his victories, his story unfolds<br>
            <br>
            White, a bright light<br>
            If there'd be any glory in war<br>
            Let it rest on man like him<br>
            (Dead men will never come back)<br>
            <br>
            Crosses grow on Anzio<br>
            Where no soldier sleeps and where hell's six feet deep<br>
            That death does wait, there's no debate<br>
            So charge and attack, going to hell and back<br>
            <br>
            A man of the 15th, a man of can do<br>
            Friends fall around him and yet he came through<br>
            Let them fall face down, if they must die<br>
            Making it easier to say goodbye<br>
            <br>
            White, a bright light<br>
            If there'd be any glory in war<br>
            Let it rest on man like him<br>
            (Who went to hell and came back)<br>
            <br>
            Crosses grow on Anzio<br>
            Where no soldier sleeps and where hell's six feet deep<br>
            That death does wait, there's no debate<br>
            So charge and attack, going to hell and back<br>
            <br>
            Oh, gather 'round me, and listen while I speak<br>
            Of a war where hell is six feet deep<br>
            And all along the shore, where cannons still roar<br>
            They're haunting my dreams, they're still there when I sleep<br>
            <br>
            He saw crosses grow on Anzio<br>
            Where no soldier sleeps and where hell's six feet deep<br>
            That death does wait, there's no debate<br>
            He charged and attacked, he went to hell and back<br>
        </p>
