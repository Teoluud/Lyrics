        <h1>Great War</h1>
        <p>
            Where dead men lies, I'm paralyzed<br>
            My brothers' eyes are gone<br>
            And he shall be buried here<br>
            Nameless marks his grave<br>
            Mother home get a telegraph<br>
            And shed a tear of grief<br>
            Mud and blood in foreign land<br>
            Trying to understand<br>
            <br>
            Where is this greatness I've told?<br>
            This is the lies that we've been sold<br>
            Is this a worthy sacrifice?<br>
            <br>
            Great War!<br>
            And I cannot take more<br>
            Great tour<br>
            I keep on marchin' on<br>
            I play the<br>
            Great score<br>
            There will be no encore<br>
            Great War!<br>
            The war to end all wars<br>
            <br>
            I'm standing here, I'm full of fear<br>
            With bodies at my feet<br>
            Over there, in the other trench<br>
            Bullets wear my name<br>
            Lead ahead, as the captain said<br>
            And show them no remorse<br>
            Who am I to understand<br>
            What have I become?
            <br>
            I do my duties pay the price<br>
            I'll do the worthy sacrifice<br>
            I know my deeds are not in vain<br>
            <br>
            Great War!<br>
            And I cannot take more<br>
            Great tour<br>
            I keep on marchin' on<br>
            I play the<br>
            Great score<br>
            There will be no encore<br>
            Great War!<br>
            The war to end all wars<br>
            <br>
            And feet by feet<br>
            We pay the price of a mile here<br>
            Though men are falling, we see heroes rise<br>
            We face the heat<br>
            As we are fighting until the dawn<br>
            So follow me, and we will write our own history!<br>
            <br>
            Great War!<br>
            And I cannot take more<br>
            Great tour<br>
            I keep on marchin' on<br>
            I play the<br>
            Great score<br>
            There will be no encore<br>
            Great War!<br>
            The war to end all wars<br>
