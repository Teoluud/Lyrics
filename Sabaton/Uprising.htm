        <h1>Uprising</h1>
        <p>
            Warsaw rise<br>
            <br>
            Do you remember when<br>
            When the Nazis forced their rule on Poland<br>
            1939<br>
            And the allies turned away<br>
            <br>
            From the underground<br>
            Rose a hope of freedom as a whisper<br>
            City in despair<br>
            But they never lost their faith<br>
            <br>
            Women, men and children fight<br>
            They were dying side by side<br>
            And the blood they shed upon the streets<br>
            Was a sacrifice willingly paid<br>
            <br>
            Warsaw, city at war<br>
            Voices from underground<br>
            Whispers of freedom<br>
            1944, help that never came<br>
            Calling Warsaw, city at war<br>
            Voices from underground<br>
            Whispers of freedom<br>
            Rise up and hear the call<br>
            History calling to you<br>
            <br>
            Warszawo, walcz!<br>
            <br>
            Spirit, soul and heart<br>
            In accordance with the old traditions<br>
            1944<br>
            Still the allies turn away<br>
            <br>
            Fighting street to street<br>
            In a time of hope and desperation<br>
            Did it on their own<br>
            And they never lost their faith<br>
            <br>
            Women, men, and children fight<br>
            They were dying side by side<br>
            And the blood they shed upon the streets<br>
            Was a sacrifice willingly paid<br>
            <br>
            Warsaw, city at war<br>
            Voices from underground<br>
            Whispers of freedom<br>
            1944, help that never came<br>
            Calling Warsaw, city at war<br>
            Voices from underground<br>
            Whispers of freedom<br>
            Rise up and hear the call<br>
            History calling to you<br>
            <br>
            Warszawo, walcz!<br>
            <br>
            <i>
                All the streetlights<br>
                In the city<br>
                Broken many years ago<br>
                Break the curfew<br>
                Hide in sewers<br>
                Warsaw, it's time to rise now<br>
