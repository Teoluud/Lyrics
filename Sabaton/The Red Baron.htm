        <h1>The Red Baron</h1>
        <p>
            Man and machine and nothing there in between<br>
            The flying circus and a man from Prussia<br>
            The sky and a plane, this man commands his domain<br>
            The western front and all the way to Russia<br>
            <br>
            Death from above, you're under fire<br>
            Stained red as blood, he's roaming higher<br>
            <br>
            Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies<br>
            That's where the legend will arise<br>
            And he's flying<br>
            <br>
            Higher, the king of the sky<br>
            He's flying too fast and he's flying too high<br>
            Higher, an eye for an eye<br>
            The legend will never die<br>
            <br>
            First to the scene, he is a lethal machine<br>
            It's bloody April and the tide is turning<br>
            Fire at will, it is the thrill of a kill<br>
            Four in a day shot down with engines burning<br>
            <br>
            Embrace the fame, red squadron leader<br>
            Call out his name: "Rote Kampfflieger"<br>
            <br>
            In the game to win, a gambler rolls the dice<br>
            Eighty allies paid the price<br>
            And he's flying<br>
            <br>
            Higher, the king of the sky<br>
            He's flying too fast and he's flying too high<br>
            Higher, an eye for an eye<br>
            The legend will never die<br>
            <br>
            Higher
            <br>
            Higher, the king of the sky<br>
            He's flying too fast, again, he's flying too high<br>
            He's flying higher, an eye for an eye<br>
            The legend will never die<br>
            <br>
            Higher
            <br>
            Born a soldier from the horseback to the skies<br>
            And the legend never dies<br>
            <br>
            And he's flying<br>
            And he's flying<br>
            And he's flying<br>
            <br>
            Higher, the king of the sky<br>
            He's flying too fast and he's flying too high<br>
            Higher, an eye for an eye<br>
            The legend will never die<br>
            <br>
            Higher, the king of the sky<br>
            He's flying too fast and he's flying too high<br>
            Higher, an eye for an eye<br>
            The legend will never die<br>
