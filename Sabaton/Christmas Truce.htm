        <h1>Christmas Truce</h1>
        <p>
            Silence<br>
            Oh I remember the silence<br>
            On a cold winter day<br>
            After many months on the battlefield<br>
            And we were used to the violence<br>
            Then all the cannons went silent<br>
            And the snow fell<br>
            Voices sang to me from<br>
            No man's land<br>
            <br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all friends<br>
            <br>
            And today we're all brothers<br>
            Tonight we're all friends<br>
            A moment of peace in a war<br>
            That never ends<br>
            Today we're all brothers<br>
            We drink and unite<br>
            Now Christmas has arrived<br>
            And the snow turns the ground white<br>
            Hear carols from the trenches<br>
            We sing 'O holy night'<br>
            Our guns lay to rest<br>
            Among snowflakes<br>
            A Christmas in the trenches<br>
            A Christmas on the front<br>
            Far from home<br>
            <br>
            Madness<br>
            Oh I remember the sadness<br>
            We were hiding our tears<br>
            In a foreign land where we faced our fears<br>
            We were soldiers<br>
            Carried the war on our shoulders<br>
            For our nations<br>
            Is that why we bury our friends<br>
            <br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all friends<br>
            <br>
            And today we're all brothers<br>
            Tonight we're all friends<br>
            A moment of peace in a war<br>
            That never ends<br>
            Today we're all brothers<br>
            We drink and unite<br>
            Now Christmas has arrived<br>
            And the snow turns the ground white<br>
            Hear carols from the trenches<br>
            We sing 'O holy night'<br>
            Our guns lay to rest<br>
            Among snowflakes<br>
            A Christmas in the trenches<br>
            A Christmas on the front<br>
            Far from home<br>
            <br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all<br>
            We are all friends<br>
            <br>
            And today we're all brothers<br>
            Tonight we're all friends<br>
            A moment of peace in a war<br>
            That never ends<br>
            Today we're all brothers<br>
            We drink and unite<br>
            Now Christmas has arrived<br>
            And the snow turns the ground white<br>
            A Christmas on the frontline<br>
            We walk among our friends<br>
            We don't think about tomorrow<br>
            The battle will commence<br>
            When we celebrated Christmas<br>
            We thought about our friends<br>
            Those who never made it home<br>
            When the battle had commenced<br>
