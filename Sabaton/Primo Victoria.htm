        <h1>Primo Victoria</h1>
        <p>
            Through the gates of hell<br>
            As we make our way to heaven<br>
            Through the nazi lines<br>
            Primo victoria<br>
            <br>
            We've been training for years<br>
            Now we're ready to strike<br>
            As the great operation begins<br>
            We're the first waves on shore<br>
            We're the first ones to fall<br>
            Yet soldiers have fallen before<br>
            <br>
            In the dawn they will pay<br>
            With their lives as the price<br>
            History's written today<br>
            In this burning inferno<br>
            Know that nothing remains<br>
            As our forces advance on the beach<br>
            <br>
            Aiming for heaven while serving in hell<br>
            Victory is ours, their forces will fall<br>
            <br>
            Through the gates of hell<br>
            As we make our way to heaven<br>
            Through the nazi lines<br>
            Primo victoria<br>
            <br>
            On the 6th of June<br>
            On the shores of western europe 1944<br>
            D-Day upon us<br>
            <br>
            We've been here before<br>
            Used to this kind of war<br>
            Crossfire grind through the sand<br>
            Our orders were easy<br>
            It's kill or be killed<br>
            Blood on both sides will be spilled<br>
            <br>
            In the dawn they will pay<br>
            With their lives as the price<br>
            History's written today<br>
            Now that we are at war<br>
            With the Axis again<br>
            This time we know what will come<br>
            <br>
            Aiming for heaven while serving in hell<br>
            Victory is ours, their forces will fall<br>
            <br>
            Through the gates of hell<br>
            As we make our way to heaven<br>
            Through the nazi lines<br>

            Overlord<br>
