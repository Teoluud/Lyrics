        <h1>The Final Solution</h1>
        <p>
            Country in depression<br>
            Nation in despair<br>
            One man seeking reasons everywhere<br>
            Growing hate and anger<br>
            The Fuhrer's orders were precise<br>
            Who was to be blamed and pay the price!<br>
            <br>
            Wicked propaganda<br>
            Turning neighbors into foes<br>
            Soldiers of the Third Reich searching homes<br>
            And then the former friends are watching<br>
            As they are rounded up one by one<br>
            Times of prosecutions has begun<br>
            <br>
            Ever since it started on KristallNacht '38<br>
            When liberty died and truth was denied<br>
            Sent away on trains, sent on a way trip to Hell<br>
            Enter the gates, Auschwitz awaits<br>
            <br>
            When freedom burns<br>
            The final solution<br>
            Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust<br>
            When millions burn<br>
            The curtain has fallen<br>
            Lost to the world as they perish in flames<br>
            <br>
            There was a country in depression<br>
            There was a nation in despair<br>
            One man finding reasons everywhere<br>
            Then there was raising hate and anger<br>
            The Fuhrer's orders still apply<br>
            Who was to be blamed and sent to die!<br>
            <br>
            Ever since it started on KristallNacht '38<br>
            When liberty died and truth was denied<br>
            Sent away on trains, sent on a one way trip to Hell<br>
            Enter the gates, Auschwitz awaits<br>
            <br>
            When freedom burns<br>
            The final solution<br>
            Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust<br>
            When millions burn<br>
            The curtain has fallen<br>
            Lost to the world as they perish in flames<br>
            <br>
            When freedom burns<br>
            The final solution<br>
            Dreams fade away and all hope turns to dust<br>
            When millions burn<br>
            The curtain has fallen<br>
            Lost to the world as they perish in flames<br>
