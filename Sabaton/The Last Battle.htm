        <h1>The Last Battle</h1>
        <p>
            Fifth of May, V day is just around the corner<br>
            1945, the FÃ¼hrer's reign's at its end<br>
            Jenny at the gates, as the SS open fire<br>
            There's no time to waste, the final battle's begun<br>
            <br>
            After the downfall, a castle besieged<br>
            Facing the nazis, awaiting relief<br>
            Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free<br>
            <br>
            And it's the end of the line of the final journey<br>
            Enemies leaving the past<br>
            And it's American troops and the German army<br>
            Joining together at last<br>
            <br>
            One last fight, it's the death throes of the Third Reich<br>
            Justice shall be done, the final battle remains<br>
            Ammo's running low, they're depleting their machineguns<br>
            Every bullet counts until surrender's announced<br>
            <br>
            After the downfall, a castle relieved<br>
            Defeating the nazis who held them besieged<br>
            Gangl and Lee and their men set the prisoners free<br>
            <br>
            And it's the end of the line of the final journey<br>
            Enemies leaving the past<br>
            And it's American troops and the German army<br>
            Joining together at last<br>
            <br>
            From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea<br>
            From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea<br>
            From the home of the brave, from the land of the free<br>
            From the foot of the alps to the shores of the sea<br>
            <br>
            And it's the end of the line of the final journey<br>
            Enemies leaving the past<br>
            And it's American troops and the German army<br>
            Joining together at last<br>
            <br>
            And it's the end of the line of the final journey<br>
            Enemies leaving the past<br>
            And it's American troops and the German army<br>
            Joining together at last<br>
