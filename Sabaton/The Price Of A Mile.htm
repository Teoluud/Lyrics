        <h1>The Price Of A Mile</h1>
        <p>
            Here the sound of a machine gun<br>
            Hear the echo in the night<br>
            Mortars firing rains the scene<br>
            Scars the fields that once were green<br>
            <br>
            It's a stalemate at the frontline<br>
            Were the soldiers rest in the mud<br>
            Roads and houses all is gone<br>
            There's no glory to be won<br>
            <br>
            Know that many men will suffer<br>
            Know that many men will die<br>
            Half a million lives at stake<br>
            At the fields of Passchendaele<br>
            <br>
            And as the night falls the general calls<br>
            And the battle carries on<br>
            And on<br>
            What is the purpose of it all?<br>
            What's the price of a mile?<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army on the march<br>
            Long way from home<br>
            Paying the price in young men's lives<br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army in despair<br>
            Knee-deep in mud<br>
            Stuck in a trench with no way out<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of machine guns<br>
            Kept on firing through the night<br>
            Mortars blazed and wrecked the scene<br>
            Gone's the fields that once were green<br>
            <br>
            Still a deadlock at the frontline<br>
            Where the soldiers die in a mud<br>
            Roads and houses since long gone<br>
            Still no glory has been won<br>
            <br>
            Know that many men has suffered<br>
            Know that many men has died<br>
            Six miles of ground has been won<br>
            Half a million men are gone<br>
            <br>
            And as the men crawled the general called<br>
            And the killing carried on<br>
            And on<br>
            What was the purpose of it all?<br>
            What's the price of a mile?<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army on the march<br>
            Long way from home<br>
            Paying the price in young men's lives<br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army in despair<br>
            Knee-deep in mud<br>
            Stuck in a trench with no way out<br>
            <br>
            Young men are dying<br>
            They pay the price<br>
            Oh how they suffer<br>
            So tell me what's the price of a mile?<br>
            <br>
            That's the price of a mile<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army on the march<br>
            Long way from home<br>
            Paying the price in young men's lives<br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army in despair<br>
            Knee-deep in mud<br>
            Stuck in a trench with no way out<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army on the march<br>
            Long way from home<br>
            Paying the price in young men's lives<br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army in despair<br>
            Knee-deep in mud<br>
            Stuck in a trench with no way out<br>
            <br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army on the march<br>
            Long way from home<br>
            Paying the price in young men's lives<br>
            Thousands of feet march to the beat<br>
            It's an army in despair<br>
            Knee-deep in mud<br>
            Stuck in a trench with no way out<br>
