        <h1>Winged Hussars</h1>
        <p>
            When the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            <br>
            A cry for help in time of need<br>
            Await relief from Holy League<br>
            Sixty days of siege<br>
            Outnumbered and weak<br>
            Sent a message to the skies<br>
            Wounded soldiers left to die<br>
            Will they hold the wall<br>
            Or will the city fall?<br>
            <br>
            Dedication, dedication<br>
            They're outnumbered fifteen to one<br>
            And the battle's begun<br>
            <br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            Coming down they turned the tide<br>
            <br>
            As the days are passing by<br>
            And as the dead are piling high<br>
            No escape and no<br>
            Salvation<br>
            Trenches to explosive halls<br>
            Are buried deep beneath the walls<br>
            Plant the charges there<br>
            And watch the city fear<br>
            <br>
            Desperation, desperation<br>
            It's a desperate race against the mine<br>
            And a race against time<br>
            <br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            Coming down they turned the tide<br>
            <br>
            Cannonballs are coming down from the sky<br>
            Janissaries are you ready to die?<br>
            We will seek our vegeance, eye for an eye<br>
            You'll be stopped upon the steps of our gate<br>
            On this field you're only facing our hate<br>
            But back home your Sultan's sealing your fate<br>
            <br>
            We remember, in September<br>
            That's the night Vienna was freed<br>
            We made the enemy bleed<br>
            <br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            (Stormclouds, fire and steel<br>
            Death from above make the enemy kneel)<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            (Shinig armour and wings<br>
            Death from above it's an army of Kings)<br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            (Stormclouds, fire and steel<br>
            Death from above make the enemy kneel)<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            (Shinig armour and wings<br>
            Death from above it's an army of Kings)<br>
            <br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            (Stormclouds, fire and steel<br>
            Death from above make the enemy kneel)<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            (Shinig armour and wings<br>
            Death from above it's an army of Kings)<br>
            Then the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
            (Stormclouds, fire and steel<br>
            Death from above make the enemy kneel)<br>
            Coming down the mountainside<br>
            (Shinig armour and wings<br>
            Death from above it's an army of Kings)<br>
            <br>
            We remember<br>
            In September<br>
            When the Winged Hussars arrived<br>
