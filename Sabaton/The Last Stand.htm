        <h1>The Last Stand</h1>
        <p>
            In the heart of the Holy See<br>
            In the home of Christianity<br>
            The seat of power is in danger<br>
            There's a foe of a thousand swords<br>
            They've been abandoned by their lords<br>
            Their fall from grace will pave their path to damnation<br>
            <br>
            Then the 189<br>
            In the service of heaven<br>
            They're protecting the holy line<br>
            It was 1527<br>
            Gave their lives on the steps to heaven<br>
            Thy will be done<br>
            <br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            For the home of the holy<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Gave their lives so boldly<br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            In the name of his glory<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Come and tell their story again<br>
            <br>
            Under guard of 42<br>
            Along a secret avenue<br>
            Castel Sant'Angelo is waiting<br>
            They're the guards of the Holy See<br>
            They're the guards of Christianity<br>
            Their path to history is paved with salvation<br>
            <br>
            Then the 189<br>
            In the service od heaven<br>
            They're protecting the holy line<br>
            It was 1527<br>
            Gave their lives on the steps to heaven<br>
            Thy will be done<br>
            <br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            For the home of the holy<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Gave their lives so boldly<br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            In the name of his glory<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Come and tell their story again<br>
            <br>
            Dying for salvation<br>
            With dedication<br>
            No capitulation<br>
            Annihilation<br>
            Papal commendation<br>
            Reincarnation<br>
            Heaven is your destination<br>
            Dying for salvation<br>
            With dedication<br>
            No capitulation<br>
            Annihilation<br>
            Papal commendation<br>
            Reincarnation<br>
            Heaven is your destination<br>
            In the name of God<br>
            <br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            For the home of the holy<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Gave their lives so boldly<br>
            For the grace, for the might of our lord<br>
            In the name of his glory<br>
            For the faith, for the way of the sword<br>
            Come and tell their story<br>
            Gave their lives so boldly<br>
            Come and tell the Swiss Guards' story<br>
            Again<br>
