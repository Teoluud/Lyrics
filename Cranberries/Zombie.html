            <h1>Zombie</h1>
            <p>
                Another head hangs lowly<br>
                Child is slowly taken<br>
                And the violence caused such silence<br>
                Who are we mistaken<br>
                But you see it's not me, it's not my family<br>
                In your head, in your head, they are fighting<br>
                With their tanks and their bombs<br>
                And their bombs and their guns<br>
                In your head, in your head<br>
                They are cryin'<br>
                <br>
                In your head, in your head<br>
                Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br>
                What's in your head, in your head<br>
                Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh<br>
                <br>
                Another mother's breaking<br>
                Heart is taking over<br>
                When the violence causes silence<br>
                We must be mistaken<br>
                <br>
                It's the same old theme, since nineteen-sixteen<br>
                In your head, in your head they're still fighting<br>
                With their tanks and their bombs<br>
                And their bombs and their guns<br>
                In your head, in your head<br>
                They are dying<br>
                <br>
                In your head, in your head<br>
                Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br>
                What's in your head? In your head?<br>
                Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh<br>
                Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-oh, ra-ra<br>
            </p>
        </div>
