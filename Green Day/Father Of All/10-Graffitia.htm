        <h1>Graffitia</h1>
        <p>
            Another one down at the mining town<br>
            Breaking it down for a lame wager<br>
            Calling the shots from the capital<br>
            All that we got was the banks of hope<br>
            <br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            <br>
            This city isn't big enough for dreamers<br>
            We were all believers<br>
            It's the perfect crime<br>
            (Only the lonely and wasted)<br>
            <br>
            Another black kid was shot in town<br>
            A man with the badge and a daytime show<br>
            Darkness falls on Graffitia<br>
            Death of a town in the afterglow<br>
            <br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            <br>
            All souls go to heaven in Graffitia<br>
            Singing halleluja<br>
            It's the perfect crime<br>
            (Only the lonely and wasted)<br>
            If we're going down for a good time<br>
            Life during war time<br>
            It's the perfect crime<br>
            (Only the lonely and wasted)<br>
            <br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Are we the long lost love?<br>
            <br>
            Are we the last forgotten? (Another one down at the mining town)<br>
            Are we the long lost love? (Breaking it down for a lame wager)<br>
            Are we the last forgotten? (Calling the shots from the capital)<br>
            Are we the long lost love? (All that we got was the banks of hope)<br>
            <br>
            Another one down at the mining town<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Calling the shots from the capital<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
            Another one down at the mining town<br>
            Are we the last forgotten?<br>
        </p>
