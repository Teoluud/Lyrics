        <p>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            So who is holding the drugs?<br>
            Who is holding the drugs?<br>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            Full of piss and vinegar<br>
            Living like a prisoner for haters<br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            I am an alien visitor<br>
            My life’s a mess<br>
            and school is just for suckers<br>
            <br>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            So who is holding the drugs?<br>
            Who is holding the drugs?<br>
            I don’t want to freak you out but I cannot lie<br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            Full of piss and vinegar<br>
            Living like a prisoner for haters<br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            I am an alien visitor<br>
            My life’s a mess<br>
            and school is just for suckers<br>
            <br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            Full of piss and vinegar<br>
            Living like a prisoner for haters<br>
            I was a teenage teenager<br>
            I am an alien visitor<br>
            My life’s a mess<br>
            and school is just for suckers<br>
