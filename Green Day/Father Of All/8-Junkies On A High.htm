            <h1>Junkies On A High</h1>
            <p>
                My mamma said to me<br>
                you're gonna have your enemies<br>
                don't beg don't follow<br>
                I've heard it all before<br>
                I smashed my fingers in the door<br>
                My downward spiral<br>
                Oh yeah<br>
                <br>
                Rock 'n' roll tragedy<br>
                I think the next one could be me<br>
                Heaven's my rival<br>
                I sing in revelry<br>
                I got my own conspiracies<br>
                What hides in shadows?<br>
                Oh yeah<br>
                <br>
                Junkies on a high<br>
                Get back, lay down, go low<br>
                Subdivision smile<br>
                Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up<br>
                As we watch the world burn<br>
                <br>
                I'm not a soldier<br>
                This ain't no new world order<br>
                My path don't follow<br>
                My name is nobody<br>
                My pride is my pornography<br>
                Kool-Aid's my motto<br>
                <br>
                Junkies on a high<br>
                Get back, lay down, go low<br>
                Subdivision smile<br>
                Drink it in, dumb it down, suck it up<br>
                As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)<br>
                As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)<br>
                Oh, yeah, burn (Junkies on a high)<br>
                As we watch the world burn (Junkies on a high)<br>
                Oh, yeah<br>
            </p>
