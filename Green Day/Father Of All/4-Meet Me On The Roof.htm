        <h1>Meet Me On The Roof Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            I’m crawling on the dance floor<br>
            I think I lost my phone<br>
            Feeling like a toothache<br>
            My face is going numb<br>
            I beg 1000 pardons<br>
            all my friends are crazy<br>
            hanging from the window<br>
            All you got to do is jump<br>
            <br>
            Come meet me on the roof tonight girl<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
            Oh come meet me on the roof tonight<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
            <br>
            I’m hanging with the cholos<br>
            Cruising down the strip<br>
            Sleeping with a pillow<br>
            (Don't wake me up, don't wake me up)<br>
            Waking up in spit<br>
            I’m taking drowning lessons<br>
            Secret words and true confessionals<br>
            And the worst is yet to come<br>
            <br>
            Come meet me on the roof tonight girl<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
            Oh come meet me on the roof tonight<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
            <br>
            So meet me where the good times go<br>
            How high is your low?<br>
            As far as I can go<br>
            <br>
            Come meet me on the roof tonight girl<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
            Oh come meet me on the roof tonight<br>
            Oh how high is your low gotta go girl?<br>
        </p>
