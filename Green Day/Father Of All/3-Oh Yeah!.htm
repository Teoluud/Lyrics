        <h1>Oh Yeah! Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            I’m in a crowd full of angels and demons<br>
            I’m looking out for the jingoes and heathens<br>
            Nobody move and nobody gonna get hurt<br>
            Reach for the sky with your face in the dirt<br>
            <br>
            Everybody is a star<br>
            Got my money and I’m feeling kinda low<br>
            Everybody got a scar<br>
            Ain’t it funny how we’re running out of hope?<br>
            <br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            <br>
            I got blood on my hands in my pockets<br>
            That’s what you get<br>
            Turning bullets into rockets<br>
            I am a kid of a bad education<br>
            The shooting star of a lowered expectation<br>
            <br>
            Everybody is a star<br>
            Got my money and I’m feeling kinda low<br>
            Everybody got a scar<br>
            Ain’t it funny how we’re running out of hope?<br>
            <br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            <br>
            I’m just a face in a crowd of spectators<br>
            To the sound of the voice of a traitor<br>
            Dirty looks and I’m looking for a payback<br>
            Burning books in a bulletproof backpack<br>
            <br>
            Everybody is a star<br>
            Got my money and I’m feeling kinda low<br>
            Everybody got a scar<br>
            Ain’t it funny how we’re running out of hope?<br>
            <br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            <br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            (Everybody is a star)<br>
            Yeah oh yeah oh yeah<br>
            (Everybody is a star)<br>
