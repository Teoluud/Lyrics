    <h1>Take The Money And Crawl Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
        High on a low life<br />
        Hit me with a dull knife<br />
        Sweet soul sickness<br />
        Can I get a witness<br />
        <br />
        This is the wild life<br />
        I'm gonna take a dive<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        Do I dare say please<br />
        When I'm on my knees<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        <br />
        Illegal tender<br />
        Going on a bender<br />
        Cold blooded killers<br />
        Of all the mother fuckers<br />
        <br />
        I'm in a nervous  wreck<br />
        Enough to make you sick<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        Oh yeah it's just my luck<br />
        But I don't give a fuck<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        <br />
        This is the wild life<br />
        I'm gonna take a dive<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        Do I dare say please<br />
        When I'm on my knees<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        So you take a walk<br />
        Or you can suck my cock<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
        Oh yeah it's just my luck<br />
        But I don't give a fuck<br />
        Take the money and crawl<br />
    </p>
