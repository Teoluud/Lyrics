            <h1>Take The Money And Crawl</h1>
            <p>
                High on a low life<br>
                Hit me with a dull knife<br>
                Sweet soul sickness<br>
                Can I get a witness<br>
                <br>
                This is the wild life<br>
                I'm gonna take a dive<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                Do I dare say please<br>
                When I'm on my knees<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                <br>
                Illegal tender<br>
                Going on a bender<br>
                Cold blooded killers<br>
                Of all the mother fuckers<br>
                <br>
                I'm in a nervous  wreck<br>
                Enough to make you sick<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                Oh yeah it's just my luck<br>
                But I don't give a fuck<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                <br>
                This is the wild life<br>
                I'm gonna take a dive<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                Do I dare say please<br>
                When I'm on my knees<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                So you take a walk<br>
                Or you can suck my cock<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
                Oh yeah it's just my luck<br>
                But I don't give a fuck<br>
                Take the money and crawl<br>
            </p>
