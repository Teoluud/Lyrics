        <h1>Holiday Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            Hear the sound of the falling rain<br>
            Coming down like an Armageddon Flame<br>
            The shame, the ones who died without a name<br>
            <br>
            Hear the dogs howling out of key<br>
            To a himn called faith and misery<br>
            And bleed, the company lost the war today<br>
            <br>
            I beg to dream and differ<br>
            From the hollow lies<br>
            This is the dawning of the rest of our lives<br>
            On holiday<br>
            <br>
            
        </p>
