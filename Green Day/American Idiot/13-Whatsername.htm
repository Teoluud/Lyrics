        <h1>Whatsername</h1>
        <p>
            Thought I ran into you down on the street<br>
            Then it turned out to only be a dream<br>
            I made a point to burn all of the photographs<br>
            She went away and then I took a different path<br>
            I remember the face but I can't recall the name<br>
            Now I wonder how Whatsername has been<br>
            <br>
            Seems like you disappeared without a trace<br>
            Did she ever marry oh what's his face<br>
            I made a point to burn all of the photographs<br>
            She went away and then I took a different path<br>
            I remember the face but I can't recall the name<br>
            Now I wonder how Whatsername has been<br>
            <br>
            Remember, whatever<br>
            It seems like forever ago<br>
            Remember, whatever<br>
            It seems like forever ago<br>
            The regrets are useless in my mind<br>
            And she's in my head, I must confess<br>
            The regrets are useless in my mind<br>
            And she's in my head for so long ago<br>
            <br>
            And in the darkest night<br>
            If my memory serves me right<br>
            I'll never turn back time<br>
            Forgetting you but not the time<br>
        </p>
    </div>
