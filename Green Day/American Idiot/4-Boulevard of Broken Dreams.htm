        <h1>Boulevard of Broken Dreams Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            I walk a lonely road<br>
            The only one that I ever known<br>
            Don't know where it goes<br>
            But it's home to me, and I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            I walk this empty street<br>
            On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br>
            Where the city sleeps<br>
            And I'm the only one and I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
            I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
            My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
            Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me<br>
            'til then I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            I'm walking down the line<br>
            That divides me somewhere in my mind<br>
            On the border line of the edge<br>
            On the border line of the edge<br>
            And where I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            Read between the lines<br>
            What's fucked up and everything's alright<br>
            Check my vitals signs to know I'm still alive<br>
            And I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
            I walk alone, I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            I walk this empty street<br>
            On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams<br>
            Where the city sleeps<br>
            And I'm the only one and I walk alone<br>
            <br>
            My shadow's the only one that walks beside me<br>
            My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating<br>
            Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me<br>
            'til then I walk alone<br>
        </p>
