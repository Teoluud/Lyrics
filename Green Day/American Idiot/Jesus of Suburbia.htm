        <h1>Jesus of Suburbia Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            I'm the son of rage and love<br>
            The Jesus of Suburbia<br>
            From the Bible of "None of the Above"<br>
            On a steady diet of Soda pop and Ritalin<br>
            No one ever died for my sins in hell<br>
            As far as I can tell<br>
            At least the ones I got away with<br>
            <br>
            And there's nothing wrong with me<br>
            This is how I'm supposed to be<br>
            In the land of make believe<br>
            That don't believe in me<br>
            <br>
            Get my television fix sitting on my crucifix<br>
            The living room in my private womb<br>
            While the Mom's and Brad's are away<br>
            To fall in love and fall in debt<br>
            To alcohol and cigarettes<br>
            And Mary Jane, to keep me insane<br>
            Doing someone else's cocaine<br>
            <br>
            And there's nothing wrong with me<br>
            This is how I'm supposed to be<br>
            In the land of make believe<br>
            That don't believe in me<br>
            <br>
            At the center of the Earth<br>
            In the parking lot of the 7-11 where I was taught<br>
            The motto was just a lie<br>
            It says "Home is where your heart is"<br>
            But what a shame<br>
            'cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same<br>
            It's beating out of time<br>
            <br>
            City of dead<br>
            At the end of another lost highway<br>
            Signs misleading to nowhere<br>
            City of the damned<br>
            Lost children with dirty faces today<br>
            No one really seems to care<br>
            <br>
            I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall<br>
            Like the Holy Scriptures of a shopping mall<br>
            And so it seemed to confess<br>
            It didn't say much<br>
            But it only confirmed<br>
            That the center of the Earth is the end of the world<br>
            And I could really care less<br>
            <br>
            City of dead<br>
            At the end of another lost highway<br>
            Signs misleading to nowhere<br>
            City of the damned<br>
            Lost children with dirty faces today<br>
            No one really seems to care<br>
            <br>
            I don't care if you don't.<br>
            I don't care if you don't.<br>
            I don't care if you don't care.<br>
            (x3)<br>
            I don't care<br>
            Everyone is so full of shit!<br>
            Born and raised by hypocrites<br>
            Hearts recycled but never saved<br>
            From the cradle to the grave<br>
            We are the kids of war and peace<br>
            From Anaheim to the middle east<br>
            We are the stories and disciples of<br>
            The Jesus of Suburbia<br>
            <br>
            Land of make believe<br>
            And it don't believe in me<br>
            Land of make believe<br>
            And it don't believe<br>
            And I don't care!<br>
            I don't care!<br>
            I don't care!<br>
            I don't care!<br>
            I don't care!<br>
            <br>
            Dearly beloved, are you listening?<br>
            I can't remember a word that you were saying<br>
            Are we demented, or am I disturbed?<br>
            The space that's in between insane and insecure<br>
            <br>
            Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?<br>
            Am I retarded, or am I just overjoyed?<br>
            Nobody's perfect and I stand accused<br>
            For lack of a better word and that's my best excuse<br>
            <br>
            To live and not to breathe<br>
            Is to die in tragedy<br>
            To run, to run away<br>
            To find what you believe<br>
            <br>
            And I, leave behind<br>
            This hurricane of fucking lies<br>
            <br>
            I lost my faith to this<br>
            This town that don't exist<br>
            So i run, I run away<br>
            To the light of masochists<br>
        </p>
