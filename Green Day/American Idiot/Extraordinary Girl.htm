        <h1>Extroardinary Girl Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            She's an extraordinary girl<br>
            In an ordinary world<br>
            And she can't seem to get away<br>
            He lacks the courage in his mind<br>
            Like a child left behind<br>
            Like a pet left in the rain<br>
            <br>
            She's all alone again<br>
            Wiping the tears from her eyes<br>
            Some days he feels like dying<br>
            She gets so sick of crying<br>
            <br>
            She sees the mirror of herself<br>
            And image she wants to sell<br>
            To anyone willing to buy<br>
            He steals the image in her kiss<br>
            From her hearts apocalypse<br>
            From the one called Whatsername<br>
            <br>
            She's all alone again<br>
            Wiping the tears from her eyes<br>
            Some days he feels like dying<br>
            She gets so sick of crying<br>
            <br>
            She's all alone again<br>
            Wiping the tears from her eyes<br>
            Some days he feels like dying<br>
            Some days she's not worth trying<br>
            Now that they're both up on it<br>
            She gets so sick of crying<br>
            <br>
            She's an extraordinary girl<br>
            An extraordinary girl<br>
            An extraordinary girl<br>
            An extraordinary girl<br>
        </p>
