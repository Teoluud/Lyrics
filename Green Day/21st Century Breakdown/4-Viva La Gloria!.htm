        <h1>¡Viva La Gloria! Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            HEY GLORIA<br>
            ARE YOU STANDING CLOSE TO THE EDGE?<br>
            LOOKOUT TO THE SETTING SUN<br>
            BRINK OF YOUR VISION<br>
            ETERNAL YOUTH IS<br>
            A LANDSCAPE OF THE LIE<br>
            <br>
            THE CRACKS ON MY SKIN CAN PROVE<br>
            AS THE YEARS WILL TESTIFY<br>
            SAY YOUR PRAYERS AND LIGHT A FIRE<br>
            WE’RE GOING TO START A WAR<br>
            YOUR SLOGAN’S A GUN FOR HIRE<br>
            IT’S WHAT WE WAITED FOR<br>
            <br>
            HEY GLORIA,<br>
            THIS IS WHY WE’RE ON THE EDGE<br>
            THE FIGHT OF OUR LIFE’S BEEN DRAWN TO<br>
            THIS UNDYING LOVE.<br>
            <br>
            GLORIA, VIVA LA GLORIA<br>
            YOU BLAST YOUR NAME<br>
            IN GRAFFITI ON THE WALLS<br>
            FALLING IN BROKEN GLASS AND<br>
            SLASHING THROUGH YOUR SPIRIT<br>
            I CAN HEAR IT LIKE A JILTED CROWD.<br>
            <br>
            GLORIA, WHERE ARE YOU GLORIA?<br>
            YOU FOUND A HOME<br>
            IN ALL YOUR SCARS AND AMMUNITION<br>
            YOU MADE YOUR BED IN SALAD DAYS<br>
            AMONGST THE RUINS<br>
            ASHES TO ASHES OF OUR YOUTH<br>
            <br>
            SHE SMASHED HER KNUCKLES INTO WINTER<br>
            AS AUTUMN’S WIND FADES INTO BLACK<br>
            SHE IS THE SAINT OF ALL THE SINNERS<br>
            THE ONE THAT’S FALLEN THROUGH THE CRACKS<br>
            SO DON’T PUT AWAY YOUR BURNING LIGHT<br>
            <br>
            GLORIA, WHERE ARE YOU GLORIA?<br>
            DON’T LOSE YOUR FAITH<br>
            TO YOUR LOST NAIVETE<br>
            WEATHER THE STORM AND DON’T LOOK<br>
            BACK ON LAST NOVEMBER<br>
            WHEN YOUR BANNERS WERE BURNING DOWN<br>
            <br>
            GLORIA, VIVA LA GLORIA<br>
            SEND ME YOUR AMNESTY DOWN<br>
            TO THE BROKEN HEARTED<br>
            BRING US THE SEASON<br>
            THAT WE ALWAYS WILL REMEMBER<br>
            DON’T LET THE BONEFIRES GO OUT<br>
            <br>
            SO GLORIA,<br>
            SEND OUT YOUR MESSAGE OF THE LIGHT<br>
            THAT SHADOWS IN THE NIGHT.<br>
            GLORIA, WHERE’S YOUR UNDYING LOVE?<br>
            TELL ME THE STORY OF YOUR LIFE.<br>
        </p>
