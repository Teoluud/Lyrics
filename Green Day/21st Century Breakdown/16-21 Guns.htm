        <h1>21 Guns Lyrics</h1>
        <p>
            Do you know what's worth fighting for?<br>
            When it's not worth dying for?<br>
            Does it take your breath away?<br>
            And you feel yourself suffocating<br>
            Does the pain weight out the pride?<br>
            And you look for a place to hide<br>
            Did someone break your heart inside<br>
            You're in ruins<br>
            <br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Lay down your arms<br>
            Give up the fight<br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Throw up your arms<br>
            Into the sky<br>
            You and I<br>
            <br>
            When you're at the end of the road<br>
            And you lost all sense of control<br>
            And your thoughts have taken their toll<br>
            When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul<br>
            Your faith walks on broken glass<br>
            And the hangover doesn't pass<br>
            Nothing's ever built to last<br>
            You're in ruins<br>
            <br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Lay down your arms<br>
            Give up the fight<br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Throw up your arms<br>
            Into the sky<br>
            You and I<br>
            <br>
            Did you try to live on your own?<br>
            When you burned down your house and home<br>
            Did you stand too close to the fire?<br>
            Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone<br>
            <br>
            When it's time to live and let die<br>
            And you can't get another try<br>
            Something inside this heart has died<br>
            You're in ruins<br>
            <br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Lay down your arms<br>
            Give up the fight<br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Throw up your arms<br>
            Into the sky<br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Lay down your arms<br>
            Give up the fight<br>
            One, twenty-one guns<br>
            Throw up your arms<br>
            Into the sky<br>
            You and I<br>
        </p>
