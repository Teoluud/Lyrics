        <h1>Blinding Lights</h1>
        <p>
            I've been tryna call<br>
            I've been on my own for long enough<br>
            Maybe you can show me how to love<br>
            Maybe (maybe)<br>
            I'm going through withdrawals<br>
            You don't even have to do too much<br>
            You can turn me on with just a touch<br>
            Baby (baby)<br>
            I look around and<br>
            <br>
            Sin City's cold and empty (ho)<br>
            No one's around to judge me (ho)<br>
            I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
            <br>
            And I said<br>
            Ohh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch (hey, hey)<br>
            I said<br>
            Ohh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
            Oh, when I'm like this<br>
            You're the one I trust (hey, hey)<br>
            <br>
            I'm running out of time<br>
            Cause I can see the sun light up the sky<br>
            So I hit the road in overdrive<br>
            Baby (baby)<br>
            Oh-oh-oh<br>
            <br>
            Sin City's cold and empty (ho)<br>
            No one's around to judge me (ho)<br>
            I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
            <br>
            And I said<br>
            Ohh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch (hey, hey)<br>
            I said<br>
            Ohh, I'm drowning in the night<br>
            Oh, when I'm like this<br>
            You're the one I trust<br>
            <br>
            I'm just gonna have to let you know<br>
            I could never say it on the phone<br>
            Will never let you go<br>
            This time<br>
            <br>
            And I said<br>
            Ohh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
            <br>
            Ooh, I'm blinded by the lights<br>
            No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch<br>
        </p>
