            <h1>Blinding Lights</h1>
            <p>
                I've been tryna call<br>
                I've been on my own for long enough<br>
                Maybe you can show me how to love<br>
                Maybe (maybe)<br>
                I'm going through withdrawals<br>
                You don't even have to do too much<br>
                You can turn me on with just a touch<br>
                Baby (baby)<br>
                I look around and<br>
                <br>
                Sin City's cold and empty (ho)<br>
                No one's around to judge me (ho)<br>
                I can't see clearly when you're gone<br>
                <br>
                <!--da finire-->
            </p>
