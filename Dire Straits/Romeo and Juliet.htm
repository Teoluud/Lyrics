            <h1>Romeo and Juliet</h1>
            <p>
                A lovestruck Romeo sang the streets a serenade<br>
                Laying everybody low with a love song that he made<br>
                Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade<br>
                Says something like: "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br>
                <br>
                Juliet says: "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"<br>
                He's underneath the window, she's singing: "Hey, la, my boyfriend's back<br>
                You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that<br>
                Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"<br>
                <br>
                "Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start<br>
                And I bet, and you exploded into my heart<br>
                And I forget, I forget the movie song<br>
                When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"<br>
                <br>
                Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame<br>
                Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same<br>
                And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real<br>
                How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?<br>
                <br>
                When you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold<br>
                You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold<br>
                You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah<br>
                Now you just say: "Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know, I used to have a scene with him"<br>
                <br>
                "Juliet, when we made love you used to cry<br>
                You said 'I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die'<br>
                There's a place for us, you know the movie song<br>
                When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"<br>
                <br>
                I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV<br>
                And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be<br>
                I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you<br>
                I can't do anything except be in love with you<br>
                <br>
                And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be<br>
                And all I do is keep the beat, the bad company<br>
                And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme<br>
                Julie, I'd do the stars with you any time<br>
                <br>
                "Juliet, when we made love you used to cry<br>
                You said 'I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I die'<br>
                There's a place for us you know the movie song<br>
                When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?"<br>
                <br>
                And a lovestruck Romeo, he sang the streets a serenade<br>
                Laying everybody low with a love song that he made<br>
                Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade<br>
                He says something like: "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br>
                <br>
                "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br>
