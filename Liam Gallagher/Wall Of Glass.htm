    <h1>Wall of Glass Lyrics</h1>
    <p>
        You were keeping secrets in ya<br />
        You be keeping paraphernalia<br />
        Oh I think you know<br />
        Anyone can walk up to ya<br />
        Anyone can see right through your eyes, all night<br />
        <br />
        And I don't mean to be unkind<br />
        But I see what's in your mind<br />
        And the stone you throw<br />
        Will turn back in its path<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
        <br />
        You believe in fascinations<br />
        And designer vaccinations<br />
        Love, you get along<br />
        You were sold the one direction<br />
        I believe the resurrections on<br />
        And you were wrong<br />
        <br />
        And I don't mean to be unkind<br />
        But I see what's in your mind<br />
        And the stone you throw<br />
        Will turn back in its path<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
        <br />
        And I don't mean to be unkind<br />
        But I see what's in your mind<br />
        And the stone you throw<br />
        Will turn back in its path<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        Wall of glass<br />
        One day you'll shatter like a wall of glass<br />
