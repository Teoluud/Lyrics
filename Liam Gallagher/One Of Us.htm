        <h1>One Of Us</h1>
        <p>
            Hey kid, did you know?<br>
            Today 16 years ago<br>
            It was you and I for the last time<br>
            You angrily said<br>
            With a smoke ring 'round your heads<br>
            You would see me on the other side<br>
            <br>
            C'mon I know you want more<br>
            C'mon and open your door<br>
            After it all you'll find out<br>
            You were always one of us<br>
            Act like you don't remember<br>
            You said we'd live forever<br>
            Who do you think you're kidding?<br>
            You were only one of us<br>
            In time<br>
            <br>
            When you come to mind<br>
            Disappear a thousand times<br>
            Keep me hanging on the old life<br>
            Well, I've gotta go<br>
            Maybe see you down the road<br>
            Won't you tell the kid I said goodbye<br>
            <br>
            C'mon I know you want more<br>
            C'mon and open your door<br>
            After it all you'll find out<br>
            You were always one of us<br>
            Act like you don't remember<br>
            You said we'd live forever<br>
            End up at the beginnig<br>
            You were only one of us<br>
            In time<br>
            <br>
            In<br>
            In<br>
            <br>
            C'mon I know you want more<br>
            C'mon and open your door<br>
            After it all you'll find out<br>
            You were always one of us<br>
            Act like you don't remember<br>
            You said we'd live forever<br>
            End up at the beginnig<br>
            You were only one of us<br>
            In time<br>
            <br>
            (It's a shame, a shame)<br>
            (We thought you'd change, my friend)<br>
            (But you were always one of us)<br>
            (It's a shame, a shame)<br>
            (We thought you'd change, my friend)<br>
            (But you were always one of us)<br>
