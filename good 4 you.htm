        <p>
            Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily<br>
            You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks<br>
            Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?<br>
            And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself<br>
            I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped<br>
            Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl<br>
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy<br>
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask<br>
            Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me<br>
            Baby, God, I wish that I could do that<br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom<br>
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it<br>
            But I guess good for you<br>
            <br>
            Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want<br>
            You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off<br>
            It's like we never even happened<br>
            Baby, what the fuck is up with that?<br>
            And good for you, it's like you never even met me<br>
            Remember when you swore to God I was the only<br>
            person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you<br>
            You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do<br>
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy<br>
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask<br>
            Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me<br>
            Baby, God, I wish that I could do that<br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom<br>
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it<br>
            But I guess good for you<br>
            <br>
            Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
            But your apathy's like a wound in salt<br>
            Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
            Or maybe you never cared at all<br>
            Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
            Your apathy is like a wound in salt<br>
            Maybe I'm too emotional<br>
            Or maybe you never cared at all<br>
            <br>
            Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy<br>
            Not me, if you ever cared to ask<br>
            Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me<br>
            Baby, like a damn sociopath<br>
            I've lost my mind, I've spent the night cryin' on the floor of my bathroom<br>
            But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it<br>
            But I guess good for you<br>
            <br>
            Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
