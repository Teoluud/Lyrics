            <h1>Something in the Orange</h1>
            <p>
                It'll be fine by dusk, but I'm telling you, baby<br>
                These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy<br>
                But when you place your head between my collar and jaw<br>
                I don't know much but there's no weight at all<br>
                I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't<br>
                (I'm damned if I don't)<br>
                'Cause if I say I miss you I know that you won't<br>
                (I know that you won't)<br>
                <br>
                <b>
                    But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun<br>
                    Something in the orange tells me we're not done<br>
                </b>
                <br>
                To you, I'm just a man<br>
                To me, you're all I am<br>
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?<br>
                I poisoned myself again<br>
                Something in the orange<br>
                Tells me you're never coming home<br>
                <br>
                I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night<br>
                There's orange dancing in your eyes from bulb light<br>
                Your voice only trembles when you try to speak<br>
                (When you try to speak)<br>
                Take me back to us dancing, this wood used to creak<br>
                (This wood used to creak)<br>
                <br>
                To you, I'm just a man<br>
                To me, you're all I am<br>
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?<br>
                <b>(Where the hell am I supposed to go?)</b><br>
                I poisoned myself again<br>
                Something in the orange<br>
                Tells me you're never coming home<br>
                <b>(Never coming home)</b><br>
                <br>
                To you, I'm just a man<br>
                To me, you're all I am<br>
                Where the hell am I supposed to go?<br>
                <i>(Where the hell am I supposed to go?)</i><br>
                I poisoned myself again<br>
                Something in the orange<br>
                Tells me you're never coming home<br>
                <br>
                If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way<br>
                The orange touches all things around<br>
                The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you<br>
                Please turn those headlights around<br>
                Please turn those headlights around<br>
