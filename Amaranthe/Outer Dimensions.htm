        <h1>Outer Dimensions</h1>
        <p>
            Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions<br>
            (dimensions)<br>
            <br>
            Feed me your vibrations<br>
            Your spirit over me<br>
            You're filled with the sensation<br>
            As you revive me<br>
            Intercept my darkness<br>
            Make my weakness fade away<br>
            With you I sense perfection again<br>
            <br>
            Your beautiful deeds<br>
            I cannot be deceived<br>
            <br>
            Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions<br>
            (dimensions)<br>
            Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation<br>
            (salvation)<br>
            I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions<br>
            <br>
            As the misery draws closer<br>
            You're here to save me<br>
            From delusion and deception<br>
            I walk beside you<br>
            Wrap yourself around me<br>
            And the tremors will abandon me<br>
            I'm feeling the sensation again<br>
            <br>
            Your beautiful deeds<br>
            I cannot be deceived<br>
            <br>
            Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions<br>
            (dimensions)<br>
            Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation<br>
            (salvation)<br>
            I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions<br>
            <br>
            You're taking me places<br>
            I just want to be where you are<br>
            One thousand reasons<br>
            Dimensions can't keep us apart<br>
            <br>
            Higher and higher you're taking me to outer dimensions<br>
            (dimensions)<br>
            Faster and faster you're bringing me the key to salvation<br>
            (salvation)<br>
            I wanna fly by your side, to the outer dimensions<br>
        </p>
