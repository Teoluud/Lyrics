        <h1>Amaranthine</h1>
        <p>
            Time is the reason why we fight to stay alive<br>
            Until the morning comes<br>
            It's a strife<br>
            But a shimmer in your eyes just makes me know<br>
            That you and I belong<br>
            And you can light the dark all by your own<br>
            So let us show the world our love is strong<br>
            <br>
            Like a sign, like a dream, you're my amaranthine<br>
            You are all I needed, believe me<br>
            Like we drift in a stream, your beauty serene<br>
            There's nothing else in life I ever need<br>
            My dream, amaranthine<br>
            <br>
            Time goes by as day and night are turning into dreams<br>
            But I'm lying in your arms<br>
            It's the place<br>
            Where I know that I am closest to your heart<br>
            Where the dark is torn apart<br>
            I know you feel the same as I inside<br>
            It feels like in a dream where we can fly<br>
            <br>
            Like a sign, like a dream, you're my amaranthine<br>
            You are all I needed, believe me<br>
            Like we drift in a stream, your beauty serene<br>
            There's nothing else in life I ever need<br>
            My dream, amaranthine<br>
            <br>
            It's a strife<br>
            But a shimmer in your eyes just makes me know<br>
            You're my amaranthine<br>
            <br>
            Like a sign, like a dream, you're my amaranthine<br>
            You are all I needed, believe me<br>
            <br>
            Like a sign, like a dream, you're my amaranthine<br>
            You are all I needed, believe me<br>
            Like we drift in a stream, your beauty serene<br>
            There's nothing else in life I ever need<br>
            My dream, amaranthine<br>
            </p>
