            <h1>Longshot</h1>
            <p>
                Go, ahead and tell me you got all you want<br>
                Fiver says you're wrong<br>
                And I suppose you've come down to help me<br>
                Move things along<br>
                <br />
                And we lapped it up and we're wise enough to know<br>
                How it goes to get me honey<br>
                But we're wise enough to know<br>
                How it goes to get me honey<br>
                'Cause we know this feeling all a little too well<br>
                <br />
                Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while<br>
                Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine<br>
                Every once in a while, the little things make me smile<br>
                As if one of our longshots paid off<br>
                One of our longshots paid off<br>
                <br />
                So yeah, go, ahead and tell me something real<br>
                Come on, how'd you feel?<br>
                And I suppose you've come down to help me<br>
                Add something to the reel<br>
                To the reel, to the reel<br>
                <br />
                While we laughed it off and we're wise enough, who knows?<br>
                How it goes to get me honey<br>
                When we're wise enough to know<br>
                How it goes to get me honey<br>
                'Cause we know this feeling all a little too well<br>
                <br />
                Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while<br>
                Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine<br>
                Every once in a while, the little things make me smile<br>
                As if one of the longshots paid off<br>
                One of the longshots paid off<br>
                <br />
                And its by the by<br>
                If it makes those nights fine<br>
                We were side by side again<br>
                And now, we're all careless and roughed up<br>
                You know exactly how it goes<br>
                <br />
                When you're giving us all kind of reason<br>
                Father had to go<br>
                Follow the heart I believe in, 'cause one of us must know<br>
                When you're giving us all kind of reason<br>
                Father had to go<br>
                Follow the heart I believe in, 'cause when the past is done we go<br>
                So go, so go, so go<br>
                <br />
                Listen, the distance between us, could've took a while<br>
                Once we closed that difference, you turned up like a friend of mine<br>
                Every once in a while, the little things make me smile<br>
                As if one of the longshots paid off<br>
                <br />
