        <h1>Demons Are a Girl's Best Friend</h1>
        <p>
            Beware the night<br>
            Beware the night before the dawn<br>
            Beware the dark when light is gone<br>
            For there's a phantom lust awake<br>
            They wanna make you bend and scream<br>
            They wanna take your hand and lead<br>
            You in the light of Venus, girl<br>
            Come let them take you for a ride<br>
            Forget the Lord and cross tonight<br>
            And let your carnal lust prevail tonight<br>
            <br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons come at night and they bring the end<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons come alive and they take command<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
            <br>
            Beware the fire<br>
            Beware the fire in their eyes<br>
            Beware of former driven lies<br>
            For there's a truth behind the veil<br>
            They make you part of blackened rites<br>
            For take the crave between your thighs<br>
            Your antidote of evil, girl<br>
            Come resurrect him to the sky<br>
            And wave all innocence goodbye<br>
            And let desire take command tonight<br>
            <br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons come at night and they bring the end<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons come alive and they take command<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
            <br>
            <i>
                And when your sleep is haunted in the night<br>
                Girl don't you dare to seek for candlelight<br>
                'Cause in the dark the demons come as carnal dynamite<br>
            </i>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons of the night come and take her hand<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons treat her thighs, come and make their stand<br>
            (Come and make their stand)<br>
            Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh<br>
            Demons are a girl's best friend<br>
